Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    
    An inline element will start on the current/active line and only take up
    as much space as needed (e.g. a <span>). A block element always starts on
    a new line and will take up the full width available to it on the page
    (e.g. a <div>).

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

    An element that's positioned absolutely with be positioned relative to
    the closest of its ancestors that has also had its position defined
    (i.e. not an unset positioning).

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    
    You could have a span wrapped in a div, and then define the width of
    the div. The span will expand as needed, but no wider than the width
    ingerited from the div.

    I think that also setting the display to inline-block for an element
    would do this as well, but I'm still trying to fully understand how this
    feature works.
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    
    Default is Block: <header>, <section>, <footer>
    Default is Inline: <a>, <img>
    Default is Inline-block: <button>
    
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

    The box model is the idea that all elements in HTML can be thought
    of as boxes, consisting of the content, padding, border, and margins.
    These concepts help visualize the styling and spacing of elements on
    a page. The fix for the box model is box-sizing: border-box. This allows
    the width of an element to be clearly defined, with the padding/border
    automatically falling within this width.
